<br>
**Project Overview:**
We aim to deploy a microservices-based application, specifically the Socks Shop,
using a modern approach emphasizing automation and efficiency. The goal is to use
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) for rapid and reliable deployment on Kubernetes.

<br>
<br>
**Project Instructions:**<br>
‚óè All deliverables need to be deployed using an infrastructure-as-code approach.<br>
‚óè In your solution please emphasize readability and maintainability (make your
application deployment clear). <br>
‚óè We expect a clear way to recreate your setup and will evaluate the project decisions
based on:
- Deploy pipeline
- Metrics (Alertmanager)
- Monitoring (Grafana)
- Logging (Prometheus) <br>
‚óè Use Prometheus as a monitoring tool. <br>
‚óè Use Ansible or Terraform as the configuration management tool.<br>
‚óè You can use an IaaS provider of your choice.<br>
‚óè The application should run on Kubernetes.<br>

GETTING STARTED

**Infrastructure Provisioning:**
<br>
1. Create a new directory for the Terraform configuration files and navigate to it.
```sh
mkdir Socks-Shop_Terraform
cd Socks-Shop_Terraform
```
2. Git clone this repository and navigate to the Terraform folder to have the Terraform configuration files and initiate the Terraform project. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sofrank/altschool-exam
```
3. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project:

```sh
terraform init
```
4. Run the following command to create an execution plan:
```sh
terraform plan
```
5. Run the following command to apply the changes:
```sh
terraform apply --auto-approve

#the flag --auto-approve can be added to avoid the prompt for confirmation.
```
